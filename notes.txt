CoffeBeans segmentation

I have been tasked with training a network to segment and classify coffee beans 
I have been given a small data set containing images of seperated coffee beans on a black background

So that lead us to implement an open cv based image segmentation using otso method for the threshold image
It worked quite well for well isolated coffee beans.

I tried to train a  pretrained neural network to preform mask and region detection 
due to the limited data count and limited time budget we had to add data to the problem

So we came up with a plan 
1. segment the data using the open cv algorithm
2. isolate coffee beans into seperate images (in memory)
3. construct large image with a background on it 
4. start to paste the seperate coffee beans images on it 
 4.1 construct bounding boxes in such a way
  using the first bounding box 
  when the image is placed on the background image and 
the background image
