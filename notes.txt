CoffeBeans segmentation

I have been tasked with training a network to segment and classify coffee beans 
I have been given a small data set containing images of seperated coffee beans on a black background

So that lead us to implement an open cv based image segmentation using otso method for the threshold image
It worked quite well for well isolated coffee beans.

I tried to train a  pretrained neural network to preform mask and region detection 
due to the limited data count and limited time budget we had to add data to solve the problem

So we came up with a plan 
*(for pytorch torch vision mask rcnn built in algorithms)
1. segment the data using the open cv algorithm
2. isolate coffee beans into seperate images (in memory)
3. construct large image with a background on it 
4. start to paste the seperate coffee beans images on it 
 4.1 for each bean placed assign a number to it 0 - 255
 4.2 write the data on to the final image if the data is not zero
 4.3 in a case where the bean lay on top each other just overwrite using the later data if the data is not zero 
 4.4 the final image will contain (during the bbox extraction notice code need to be added to handle the case of the current segment is missing because subsequent images overwrote some values)
 

Training using the images
using pytorch to run maskrcnn on the images
